Open Source Intelligence (OS-INT) is defined as the act of extracting and analysing information from publicly accessible sources. Its purposes include, but are not limited to national security, military intrigue, business intelligence and academic research. With the rapid growth of the reach of the internet, OS-INT has reached new highs in levels of practitioners, as well as the breadth of the content illustrated by the data. 



For this project, we are working with several different sources of data, and OS-INT practitioners, such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), who provide data which encapsulates military expenditure, armed conflict and the arms trade.


It is without doubt that the collective reliance and funding of the military industrial complex has shown massive benefits and disadvantages for individuals across the world, with corporations raking in giant profits, and conflict decimating communities worldwide. With this project, we hope to clearly visualise the direct correlation between the transfer of arms and equipment to the levels of conflict across the globe.
