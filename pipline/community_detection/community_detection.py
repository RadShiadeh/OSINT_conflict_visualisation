    Using RBConfigurationVertexPartition of leidenalg
    to get the community partition of each countries

    Parameters:
    -----------
    transfer_df : polars dataframe
        A polars dataframe that holds all the arms transfer data.
        Should be the data from the file joined_data.csv

    year : int
        The target year of data where the community detection would run on.
        If `end_year` is not specified, only the data for this year is considered.

    end_year : int, optional
        The end year of the range of years when the community detection would run on.
        If specified, the function will consider a range of years from `year` to `end_year`.

    Returns:
    --------
    partition : Dict

        the partition of the countries

        key : int
            the index of community

        value : List of strings
            the list of countries that belong to community in the index
            note that may contain names of several non gov organizations such as rebel groups

    name_index : Dict

        the index of each country name

        key : string
            the name of countries

        value : int
            the index of node
